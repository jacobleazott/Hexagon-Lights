# HEXAGON LIGHTS
 
 This code is quite a mess. It was one of those projects that once it was working I setup a simple 
 cron job and just let it run. Since it worked and looked nice I moved on to other projects.

 Currently it is not setup in my apartment due to space constraints, but when I get it setup again 
 this repo will receive a huge overhaul and likely have a shared LED controller library that 
 my Christmas tree project will also utilize.

 Latest commit was to simply "tidy" up unused code, half implemented smart home integration, and to 
 make it marginally presentable. Also to make this repo public and not hold any API keys (I was rushing).
